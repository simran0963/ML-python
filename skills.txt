AQs:

Which Machine Learning  technique is proper for grouping of similar cases in a dataset, for example to find similar patients, or for customers
segmentation in a bank?
->clustering

Why Scikit is a proper library for Machine Learning (select all the options that are correct)?
->Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library that works with Numpy and Scipy.
->Scikit-learn has most of machine learning algorithms.

Which technique/s is/ are considered as supervised learning?
->classification, regression.


***********************************************************************************************************************************************
Assignment-I:

Supervised learning deals with unlabeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with labelled data.
False

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, and supervised learning deals with labelled data


Question 2
The "Regression" technique in Machine Learning is a group of algorithms that are used for:
Answer: 2.
1. Prediction of class/category of a case; for example, a cell is benign or malignant, or a customer will churn or not.


2. Predicting a continuous value; for example predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics.


3. Finding items/events that often co-occur; for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a customer.

Regression techniques are used for continuous variable prediction, whereas classification techniques handle dependent variables with discrete classes.


Question 3
When comparing Supervised with Unsupervised learning, is this sentence True or False?

In contrast to Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning has more models and more evaluation methods that can be used in order to ensure the outcome of the model is accurate.
False
Unsupervised learning has fewer models and evaluation methods than Supervised learning.

GRADED QUIZ 1

Question 1
In a dataset, what do the columns represent? features

Question 2
What is a major benefit of unsupervised learning over supervised learning?

Discover previously unknown information about the dataset.
    Being able to produce a prediction based on unlabelled data.
    Better evaluates the performance of a built model.
    Explore the relationship between features and the target.

Question 3
What’s the correct order for using a model?

    Clean the data, split the data into training and test sets, fit the model on the train set, evaluate model accuracy.
    xSplit the data into training and test sets, fit the model on the train set, evaluate model accuracy.
Clean the data, fit the model on the entire dataset, split the data into training and test sets, evaluate model accuracy.
    xSplit the data into the training and test sets, fit the model on the train set, clean the data, evaluate model accuracy.

Question 4
Which of the following is suitable for an unsupervised learning?

    xPredict house price based on location, house size, and number of rooms.
    xClassifying benign and malignant tumors using historical data on tumor shape, color, etc.
Segment customers into groups for discovering similar characteristics between them.
    xExamine the relationship between academic performance and level of in-class participation using observations that include a feature recording each student’s grade.

Question 5
The main purpose of the NumPy library is to: 

    Achieve scientific computations.
    Construct machine learning models.
Perform computations on arrays efficiently.
    Visualize results in 2D and 3D plots.

WEEK-2
    Model evaluation in regressio models:
    qs1.Which sentence is NOT TRUE about model accuracy?
        If a model is overly trained to the dataset, it may capture noise and produce a non-generalized model.
        Having a high training accuracy may result in an ‘over-fit’ of the data. 
    Doing a train and test on the same dataset will cause very high out-of-sample accuracy.
    
    qs2. In the context of regression, what is the error of a model?   
    The difference between the data points and the trend line generated by the algorithm  
        The difference between predicted values 
        "Out of sample" accuracy
