AQs:

Which Machine Learning  technique is proper for grouping of similar cases in a dataset, for example to find similar patients, or for customers
segmentation in a bank?
->clustering

Why Scikit is a proper library for Machine Learning (select all the options that are correct)?
->Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library that works with Numpy and Scipy.
->Scikit-learn has most of machine learning algorithms.

Which technique/s is/ are considered as supervised learning?
->classification, regression.


***********************************************************************************************************************************************
Assignment-I:

Supervised learning deals with unlabeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with labelled data.
False

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, and supervised learning deals with labelled data


Question 2
The "Regression" technique in Machine Learning is a group of algorithms that are used for:
Answer: 2.
1. Prediction of class/category of a case; for example, a cell is benign or malignant, or a customer will churn or not.


2. Predicting a continuous value; for example predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics.


3. Finding items/events that often co-occur; for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a customer.

Regression techniques are used for continuous variable prediction, whereas classification techniques handle dependent variables with discrete classes.


Question 3
When comparing Supervised with Unsupervised learning, is this sentence True or False?

In contrast to Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning has more models and more evaluation methods that can be used in order to ensure the outcome of the model is accurate.
False
Unsupervised learning has fewer models and evaluation methods than Supervised learning.

Question 2
What is a major benefit of unsupervised learning over supervised learning?

Discover previously unknown information about the dataset.
Being able to produce a prediction based on unlabelled data.
Better evaluates the performance of a built model.
Explore the relationship between features and the target.

Question 3
What’s the correct order for using a model?

Clean the data, split the data into training and test sets, fit the model on the train set, evaluate model accuracy.
Split the data into training and test sets, fit the model on the train set, evaluate model accuracy.
Clean the data, fit the model on the entire dataset, split the data into training and test sets, evaluate model accuracy.
Split the data into the training and test sets, fit the model on the train set, clean the data, evaluate model accuracy.
